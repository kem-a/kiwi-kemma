Kiwi is a GNOME Shell extension that mimics various macOS features. This extension provides a collection of small quality-of-life functionalities such as moving windows to new workspaces, adding the username to the quick menu, focusing launched windows, and more.



## Features

- **Move Window to New Workspace**: Automatically move fullscreen app to new workspace.
- **Add Username to Quick Menu**: Display the username in the quick settings menu.
- **Focus Launched Window**: Focus on newly launched windows. Removes the annoying window-ready notification.
- **Lock Icon**: Display Caps Lock or Num Lock icon in the GNOME top panel.
- **Transparent Move**: Make windows slightly transparent when moving.
- **Battery Percentage**: Show battery percentage in the system menu when below 25%.
- **Move calendar to the right**: Move calendar to right side and hide notifications.

- **Show Panel on Hover**: Show panel when mouse is near top edge in fullscreen
- **Hide Minimized Windows**: Hide minimized windows in the overview
- **Hide Activities Button**: Hide the Activities button in the top panel
- **Skip Overview on Login**: Do not show the overview when logging into GNOME; go directly to the desktop.
- **Set Panel Transparnecy**: Make the top panel transparent or opaque when window touches it
- **Window Control Button Style**: Set macOS window control button styles. Move to top panel for maximized windows and remove window titlebars for maximum space.
